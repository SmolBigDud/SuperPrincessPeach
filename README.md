# Super Princess Peach

A ROM hack for Super Mario Bros. that replaces Mario with Peach and vice versa.\
A ROM of Super Mario Bros. (obtained through dumping the cart) is required.

## Software

Third-party software was used to create this hack. Unless you know how to modify the ROM direcly instead of using a program, then do that if you wish. I use Windows 11, so you might want to find similar applications if you use Linux or Mac OS.
